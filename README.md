# garnish - taking the work out of boilerplate licensing 

A recent study found that [only 15% of github
projects](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/18/github_licensing_study/) have
clearly stated license terms.  Omitting a license from your open source project
limits its usefulness to the community.  

This project aims to reduce the "pain" of creating boilerplate LICENSE files for
your FOSS projects. 

## Quickstart guide 

For python devs, installing the latest release of garnish is as simple as 

    pip install garnish

If you're not a regular python user, you can also install it the standard way

    git clone git://github.com/jhamon/garnish.git
    cd garnish
    python setup.py install

Next nagivate to your project root, and use the following syntax on the command
line

    garnish <license name> <copyright holder> <your awesome project name> 

A few examples of basic usage:

    garnish gpl3 "GNU Foundation" "Emacs" 
    garnish mit "Google Inc" "Angular JS"

To see the full list of available licenses, type `garnish -h`.

Garnish can also add copyright and licensing notices at the beginning of your
source files; this is standard practice with some projects and some licenses.
Those licenses which recommend the use of headers will prompt you about it.  For
licenses that recommend this practice, the user will be prompted interactively
o. 

For those licenses which don't recommend in-file copyright and license notices,
you can still explicitly ask garnish to apply them with the `-w` or
`--with-headers` options if you would like.  copyright notices.
