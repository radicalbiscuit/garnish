Before uploading any files to PyPI, make sure to check the version numbers have
been uploaded in all of the following places:

    - `kale/__init__.py`:  This file defines `__version__`, which must be updated.
    - `setup.py` also defines version
    - `git tag 0.1.1`: it's important to tag versions in the commit history
