# TODO list:

    - Add some unit tests
    - Write documentation
    - Better code syntax detection? Filename suffix is not sufficient for
      perl/prolog .pl problem.
    - Add readme stmts for more licenses.  These should not all be the same, since for some very short licenses -- e.g. the MIT license -- it makes sense to just tack on the whole license.
    - How can I change Header() so that START and END LICENSE BLOCK lines are not necessary?
    - Prevent template_fill on user-supplied header text.
